Suggested place to find the yellow/gold pair for a good price:

[baseballsavings.com](https://www.baseballsavings.com/baseball-apparel/baseball-apparel-mens/baseball-socks-mens/twin-city-multisport-belt---socks-combo-p30083?CID=PLA&SITE_ID=B0019&gclid=CjwKCAjw9uKIBhA8EiwAYPUS3Mcbdo984IamlnmDa8txCAT1aI0odG5i-znDoptsictCCTFF2kvh3RoCDNQQAvD_BwE)

Also, the pants color is gray, and you can find these at any sports retailer (or Amazon/similar)

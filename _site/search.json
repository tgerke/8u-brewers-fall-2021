We’ll also get lots of help from team parents Meraya Pegg and Kristin Bell Gerke.\nSeveral of us are also members of the league board, so if you have general comments/suggestions for the way the league is run or would like to get involved, reach out!\nWe only set two goals each season:\nThat every player wants to return next season\nThat every player is prepared to succeed in the next season, whether this means playing up in 10U or at the next age bracket in 8U\n\nYou’ll notice that winning is not one of those goals (which may surprise you if this is not your first season in our highly competitive league). However, we’ve experienced that a lot of winning naturally occurs as we work towards the two goals – our teams are consistently very successful.\nExpectations\nWe expect everyone to be here for all practices and games\nIf your child cannot make it for some reason, please let us know in advance\nWe run tightly organized practices and preassign kids to drill groups, so when there are unexpected no-shows it throws things off\nA parent or guardian must be present for all practices/games\n\nFor field practices, baseball pants and cleats\nFor games, arrive 1 hour before start time to warm up\nThis is standard for all teams, but we organize this into a mini-practice\n\nMinimal feedback during games\nPlayers perform best when they are loose. We’ve seen it often in 8U that, when players are nervous/unsure, mistakes are common\nFor players, please don’t try to correct them or let them know about a mistake. We will do this after the game (or later) if we feel a learning opportunity is possible\nEspecially do not comment on umpire performance\n\nNo food/candy in the dugout during games\nPlay catch with your kids at home!\nOur allotted practice times are not sufficient to teach this critical skill\nWe can 100% tell within 3 practices whether kids are getting extra work at home\nBonus: you will both cherish this time\n\nWhat your child will learn\nHow the game works\nThis is the one thing casual observers of our team will recognize: “These kids know what’s going on!”\nIt is certainly possible to coach a successful 8U team by barking orders, but we take the alternate route that the kids will be better off learning the game (even if that means making some big mistakes)\n\nWe rotate positions often in practice, but in games, we typically field one or two positions per child over the season\nFew rotating positions is common in this league, but we have a specific reason for practicing it\nWe don’t have enough practice time to teach each of 9 complicated positions. We want to make sure that your child succeeds in their role\n\nWe might teach (or not teach) mechanics a little differently than traditional methods\nEvidence suggests that, at this age, allowing your child’s athleticism to drive success is a more efficient path to progress than constant mechanical adjustment which leads to overthinking\nWe won’t allow any obviously detrimental mechanical errors, but probably won’t hear us say “Squish the bug, swing level, or hands back”\nIf you want details, Travis has a library of resources he’s always happy to share\n\nIdeal outputs: Hitting\nSwing the bat fast, hit the ball hard (ideally in the air)\nGive them freedom to find their own mechanical movements that achieve this goal\nLook at any MLB team: you’ll find 9 different swings!\nDon’t emphasize where in the field they should hit it; any hard contact is good\n\nIdeal outputs: Throwing\nThrow the ball hard (ideally, on target, but a secondary concern)\nAgain, letting the kids find their own mechanical path to achieving this\nFor example, several arm slot variations can be healthy and successful\n\nDefining success\nWe strive to reward effort, not outcomes (and this is very hard for us adults)\nEasy wins: run hard, swing hard, throw hard\nExample of how parents talk about the game: “Did you win?” “Danny went 4/4!”\nExample of better ways to recap: “Danny hit the ball to the outfield and had one of the fastest times running to first base.”\n\nEquipment\nHelmet\nBat: 2’ 5/8\" max diameter, try to get as light as possible (can make a huge difference). Must be USA stamped\nGlove\nAlso a big difference-maker: make sure it’s leather and used/broken-in gloves are encouraged. Don’t get one too small!\n\nCleats: we’re going to have them run!\nChest protector / heart guard\nProtective cup\nCoordinating\nWe will have a team website in addition to the regular SSU app site\nGameChanger Team Manager – reach out to us about the live streams\nWe will create text message list\nGames begin 9/11\nWe can always use more help!\nAssistant coaches: you can never have too many at this age\nThere is a compliance process to be completed, and you’ll have to wait for a temporary badge to join us on the field\n\nHelp with stat keeping: if interested, talk to Travis\nSnacks after games\nNeed volunteers, Meraya/Kristin will coordinate\n\nScorekeeper(s)\nRequired in the book when we are home team\n\nWe will have concession duties, likely twice\nI mentioned in the introductory email about sponsors, so if you know of a business that may be willing to help/wants a banner hung, please let me know\n\n\n\n",

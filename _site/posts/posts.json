Order of stations (as soon as they finish one, go to the back of the line at the next station): infield machine (Travis/Justin), cage (Stu), outfield heavy balls (Guy).

Rotate through P, C, 2B, SS, 3B. Go through line 5 times at each station. Repeat cycle if time allows.\nRF: Around the world with mini hitting plyos (the weight of these is good for encouraging catches in pocket of glove rather than on the hand). Stand 5-10 ft from each player, throw around their body starting in 1 o’clock position through 11; 12 o’clock goes straight to chest. Emphasizing when to use backhand catch (importantly, including the one at the chest).\nLF: Goalie drill. Place 2 cones 15ft apart. Coach tries to score points by getting grounders past the fielder and between the cones. This is about blocking the ball (even if diving, so coach: make this fun). 2 minute rounds.\nOffense\n6:15-6:40: Hitting/running in 2 stations, 8 minutes each. Parent meetings happen during this phase.\nExplain running, touching bases, scoring on mini-field. Explain how getting outs stops the scoring. Group 1 kids try to score, coach rolls very easy grounders to Group 2 to get outs. Focus here is running fast and also recognizing that you cannot be tagged out when you are on a base.\nMini-hitting plyos in opposite corner of field, 6 pitches each, rotate.\nCompetition\n6:40-7:00 3-team baseball (potentially with a tennis ball depending on field location).

    "contents": "\nDynamic warm-up\nArrival - 5:35: Soccer\n5:35-5:40: Standard stretching routine led by a player\n– If you are curious about “why use a dynamic warmup?” see Fletcher, JSCR 2007 for details on how standard static stretching routines do not promote as much activation / blood flow and reduce power output compared to dynamic routines.\nDefense\n5:40-6:05: Fielding in 3 stations (groups below), 8 minutes each.\nIF: Rolled grounders from home (not hit with a bat; this improves accuracy and efficiency) + throwing to knock a cone off the top of a tee at 1B from all positions. Rotate through P, C, 2B, SS, 3B. Go through line 5 times at each station. Repeat cycle if time allows.\nRF: Around the world with mini hitting plyos (the weight of these is good for encouraging catches in pocket of glove rather than on the hand). Stand 5-10 ft from each player, throw around their body starting in 1 o’clock position through 11; 12 o’clock goes straight to chest. Emphasizing when to use backhand catch (importantly, including the one at the chest).\nLF: Goalie drill. Place 2 cones 15ft apart. Coach tries to score points by getting grounders past the fielder and between the cones. This is about blocking the ball (even if diving, so coach: make this fun). 2 minute rounds.\nOffense\n6:05-6:30: Hitting/running in 2 stations, 8 minutes each. Parent meetings happen during this phase.\nExplain running, touching bases, scoring on mini-field. Explain how getting outs stops the scoring. Group 1 kids try to score, coach rolls very easy grounders to Group 2 to get outs. Focus here is running fast and also recognizing that you cannot be tagged out when you are on a base.\nMini-hitting plyos in opposite corner of field, 6 pitches each, rotate.\nCompetition\n6:30-6:50 3-team baseball (potentially with a tennis ball depending on field location). Rotate the 3 groups through hitting / IF / OF\nPlayers (group)\nJames P (1)  Carter G (2)  Bodey (3)  Merit (1)  Carter R (2)  Joslyn (3)  Colin (1)  Wesley (2)  Alexander (3)  Eliot (1)  James A (2) \n\n\n\n",
